# Creative-Coding-Challenge 

## __Description:__
<p><b>Our creative coding challenge is called the Interactive sketch. The Interactive Sketch uses the pre-trained Sketch RNN machine learning model (available with the ml5.js library) to create a p5.js sketch that finishes a person’s drawing. Also, we used this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCXkvwLxBrA&amp;feature=emb_logo from the coding train as a reference.</b></p>

## __Learning experience:__
<p><b>Throughout this challenge (interactive sketch) we learned many different things. We learned about different and useful functions that can be used in the future, a new awesome algorithm called the Roger-Douglas-Peucker (RDP) algorithm, and finally we learned that this mechanism could be very helpful in the future for the hazardous jobs. Making these jobs easier and less dangerous. Overall, analysing the code and testing different features like changing the colours, trying out different options, and adding new features, was pretty fun and a good learning experience.
