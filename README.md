# Creative-Coding-Challenge 

## __Description:__
Our creative coding challenge is called the Interactive sketch. The Interactive Sketch uses the pre-trained Sketch RNN machine learning model (available with the ml5.js library) to create a p5.js sketch that finishes a personâ€™s drawing. Also, we used this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCXkvwLxBrA&amp;feature=emb_logo from the coding train as a reference.
